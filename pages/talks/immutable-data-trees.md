# Where I come from?

- uni times, Clojure times
- GUI FTW

# Clojure

- functional
- immutable data structures
- Lisp

# Clojure (stealing from)

- functional
- **immutable data structures**
- Lisp

# Why immutability?

- enforce separation between things
- (functions, modules, third-party code)

# Why immutability?

avoid side effects of one *thing* changing state of another

# Why immutability?

- security
- (to ensure no one's messing with our data)

# Why immutability?

- avoid copying data over and over
- (that we maybe do to enforce security)

# Different ways of sharing state

- When passing data from one place to another…
- (function, module, third-party code)

# …with a convention

# Send data as-is

*with a convention N<sup>o</sup>1*

data belongs to the sender,<br>
receiver shouldn't modify

# Send data as-is

*with a convention N<sup>o</sup>2*

data belongs to the receiver,<br>
sender shouldn't modify

# Send data as-is

*with a convention N<sup>o</sup>3*

both sender and receiver can modify<br><span class="parenthesis">:(</span>

# Conventions, meh

A newcomer will break it

# Conventions, meh

- You will break it
- (because you forgot or had a bad day)

# Conventions, meh

- Laura and Mike agree
- but Zenon doesn't care

(third-party code)

# Computer!

program computers, not people

# …with Object.freeze

# Object.freeze (ES5)

has to be done recursively for full immutability

# Object.freeze

- any modification: full copy.
- ES5 browsers only (no IE8)

# …with a function

# Protecting data in JavaScript

secure and portable way:

- make it private to a function (closure)
- function controls access to it's data

# MVCC

# Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

- immutable
- versioned
- old (DBs, Clojure, Haskell, Scala)

# MVCC

- each version is immutable
- each *mutation* creates a new version

# MVCC in DBs

- writes don't block reads
- readers never see inconsistent state
- allow rollback

# Clojure's persistent data structures

MVCC

# Clojure's persistent data structures

- structure sharing between versions
- only the part affected by the update is copied

# Clojure's structure sharing

- collection is internally a tree instead of being flat
- nice performance characteristics

# Clojure's structure sharing

- saves RAM
- saves operations when creating new versions

# Clojure's persistent data structures

- nearly constant lookups and updates
- (log<sub>32</sub>N)

# How it works?

(and making peace with immutability)

***

    v0 = ["a", "s", "d", "f"]

# Let's make a binary tree

***

    { 00: "a"
      01: "s"
      10: "d"
      11: "f" }

(keys in binary code)

***

    0 | 0 "a"
    0 | 1 "s"
    1 | 0 "d"
    1 | 1 "f"

(divide keys to 1 bit sized chunks)

# Store data in a binary tree

(each chunk of the key is an address for one level of the tree)

    { 0: { 0: "a",
           1: "s" },

      1: { 0: "d",
           1: "f" } }

# Lookup performance

2 (16 elements, log<sub>4</sub>16 = **2**)

- we chose **2 bit** chunk size

- key is split to **2 chunks**
- tree has to be **2-level** deep

**2** lookups

What happens if we

- increase chunk size to 5
- increase array size to 32768 (2<sup>15</sup>)

?

# Lookup performance (5 bit)

- (00000 00000 00000)

# A case for MVC frameworks

MVC frameworks need to know when to update the view

*Have my data changed?*

# A case for MVC frameworks

mutable data:

- either one recursive check or many pin-pointed checks (similar complexity)
- recursive == slow
- recursive == RAM hungry (two full copies)
- :(

# A case for MVC frameworks

immutable:

- only root reference has to be checked
- MVC holds the reference to the old root
- very memory efficient with structure sharing
- :)

# A case for MVC frameworks

Using immutable data might actually speed up you MVC application.

**MVC <span class="heart">❤</span> MVCC**

# Choice is yours

<ul class="or_list">
<li>immutable data **everywhere**
<li>on **function** boundary
<li>on **module** boundary
<li>on **you | third-party** boundary
<li>mutable data
</ul>

# In a functional program…

data made immutable as soon as received (HTTP request, file read)

# In a functional program…

profiler: find bottlenecks<br>
critical parts made mutable if needed

# In a functional program…

mutable data considered a type of premature optimisation

# Immutable data in JavaScript

# Quick reminder

already immutable:

- numbers
- strings
- bools
- …

# Existing libraries (mori, …)

- give it a tree, only root level is immortalised
- non-recursive

# mori

- much more than just data (whole collection API of ClojureScript)

# Ancient Oak

an experiment with interface and implementation

# Ancient Oak

Clojure-style MVCC library for plain JavaScript data **trees**

(with emphasis on trees)

# Ancient Oak

- gets whole trees of data in
- processes recursively
- no need to wrap anything separately

# Ancient Oak

returns a function (the getter) with various update/iterate methods

# Ancient Oak

    => I({ a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ] })

    <= { [Function get]
         set:   [Function set],
         patch: [Function patch],
         map:   [Function map],
         … }

# Ancient Oak

Easy in, easy out

    data = I({ a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ] })

    => data.dump()
    <= { a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ] }

# Ancient Oak

Every node of the tree is a tree on its own.

    tree = I({ a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ] })

    => tree("b")
    <= { [Function get]
         … }

# Ancient Oak's types

1:1 mapping between native JavaScript types and immutable ones

(Array, Object)

# Array (Ancient Oak)

- sorted unsigned integer keys,
- size reported in `size` property instead of `length` (because it's a function)

# Object (Ancient Oak)

unsorted map, string keys

# Ancient Oak assumptions

- functions and primitive types treated as immutable
- functions are assumed to be interfaces to data (getters)

# Ancient Oak

- good for storing plain data
- and nothing else (atm)

# API: get

    data = I({ a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ]})
    data         // function…
    data("a")    // 1
    data("b")    // function…
    data("b")(1) // 3

# API: dump & json

    data = I({ a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ]})

    => data.dump()
    <= { a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ] }

    => data.json()
    <= '{"a":1,"b":[2,3]}'

# API: set

    v0 = I({ a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ] })
    v1 = v0.set("c", 5).set("a", 4)

    => v0.dump()
    <= { a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ] }

    => v1.dump()
    <= { a: 4, b: [ 2, 3 ], c: 5 }

# API: rm

remove an address from the tree

    v0 = I({ a: 1, b: { c: 3, d: 4 } })
    v1 = v0.rm("b", "d")

    => v1.dump()
    <= { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } }

# API: update

apply a function on a value

    v0 = I({ a: 1, b: 2 })
    v1 = v0.update("a", function (v) {
      return v + 1
    })

    => v1.dump()
    <= { a: 2, b: 2 }

# API: patch

apply a diff on the whole tree

    v0 = I({ a: 1, b: [ 2, 3 ] })
    v1 = v0.patch({
      a: 2,
      b: { 0: 4, 3: 5 }
    })

    => v1.dump()
    <= { a: 2,
         b: [ 4, 3, , 5 ] }

# API: iteration

- currently forEach, map and reduce
- mostly same as native semantics
- only reduce is a bit incompatible (easy fix)

# API: map

returns the same type of collection as the original (object/array)

    v0 = I({ a: 1, b: 2 })
    v1 = v0.map(function (v) {
      return v + 1
    })

    => v1.dump()
    <= { a: 2, b: 3 }

# API: data as a function

    data = I({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3})

    => [ "a", "b", "c"].map(data)
    <= [ 1, 2, 3 ]

# Contributions welcome

- still early stage
- target is to handle JSONifiable data
- tweaking for speed
- suggestions to API?
- any ideas about storing dates?<br>(and stuff with getters and setters)
